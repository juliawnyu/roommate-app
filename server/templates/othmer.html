    <h2>Welcome to Othmer Hall!</h2>

    <p>Located in Downtown Brooklyn, the Donald F. and Mildred Topp Othmer Residence
        Hall is an 18-story building, housing over 400 NYU students in both traditional
        and apartment-style suites. The residence includes student lounge access on
        each floor and laundry facilities in the basement. Our 12 Resident Assistants (RAs)
        and one Faculty Fellow-in-Residence are here to help facilitate community building,
        enhance your academic experience, plan events, and provide support during your time
        at Othmer Hall. Throughout the year, there are also many opportunities to get involved,
        especially with our Hall Council - our very own hall government where you can run for an
        elected position or serve on the general assembly!</p>
