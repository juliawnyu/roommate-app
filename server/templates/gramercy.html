    <h2>Welcome to Gramercy Green!</h2>
    <p>Located in the Gramercy Park area of NYC, this residence hall offers NYU students a unique
        living experience with a variety of amenities and living-learning opportunities. Primarily
        housing sophomore students, the building maintains 20 resident assistants, three Faculty
        Fellows-in-Residence, two Explorations communities, and two Chaplains in Residence. The
        facilities include TV, computer, and study lounges, a fitness center, as well as a large
        programming space for a variety of events and activities.

        The area in which Gramercy Green is located draws upon its connection with numerous historic
        landmarks nearby, including the Beaux Arts Appellate Courthouse, the Flatiron Building,
        the MetLife Clock Tower, the New York Life Building, and the Empire State Building. The
        Greenmarket at Union Square is the favorite local shopping destination for the Gramercy
        residents but the area also houses a variety of grocery stores and local delis. Stores of all
        descriptions can be found on Park Avenue South, and there is an expansive choice of restaurants
        in the area. Today, the Gramercy Park area is a thriving neighborhood with the right mix of
        stores and residential buildings.</p>
